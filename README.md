#  About This Portfolio
This portfolio highlights my hands-on cybersecurity projects focused on:

- Log analysis and authentication forensics  
- SSH brute-force detection  
- SIEM-style investigations  
- Linux security and system auditing  
- Bash scripting for automation  
- Wireshark traffic analysis (DNS, TCP, ARP, TLS, HTTP)  
- SOC-style reporting and documentation  

All projects are based on real-world defensive workflows used by Tier 1 SOC Analysts.
