#  About Me  
I am *Alex Ojo, an aspiring **Cybersecurity Analyst / SOC Analyst*, building strong hands-on skills in:

- Linux security  
- SIEM investigations  
- Network forensics  
- Log analysis  
- Incident detection  
- Attack simulation  
- Detection engineering fundamentals  

I recently completed the *Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate* and the *IBM Cybersecurity course*, and I am actively developing SOC-ready projects based on real-world attack scenarios.

This portfolio shows my *practical, hands-on cybersecurity experience*.
