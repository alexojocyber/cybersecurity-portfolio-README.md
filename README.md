# About Me  
I’m *Alex Ojo*, an entry-level Cybersecurity Analyst & SOC Analyst (Tier 1) focusing on:

- Linux forensics  
- Network analysis  
- Log investigation  
- SIEM workflows  
- SSH brute-force detection  
- File/script security analysis  
- Threat detection & incident reporting  

I recently completed *Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate* and *IBM Cybersecurity, and I'm building **hands-on, employer-ready SOC projects*.

This portfolio showcases REAL investigations, not theory.

##  1. SIEM Investigation Labs  
In this project, I analyzed *real Linux attack scenarios*, including:

### ✔ *Investigation 1: Failed Login Analyzer Script*  
- Extracted failed login attempts  
- Identified targeted usernames  
- Investigated attacker IPs  

### ✔ *Investigation 2: SSH Brute-force Attack (Hydra)*  
- Executed brute-force simulation  
- Analyzed failed password attempts  
- Extracted IoCs from journalctl  
- Recommended SSH hardening steps  

### ✔ *Investigation 3: File & Script Behavior Analysis*  
- Detected unauthorized file creation/deletion  
- Analyzed malicious-style Bash logic  
- Investigated ${1,,} user identity comparison  
- Documented suspicious patterns

##  2. Wireshark Network Analysis  
Performed packet-level analysis of core internet protocols:

- DNS Query/Response  
- TCP SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK handshake  
- ARP broadcast + reply  
- HTTP GET / TLS handshake  

Includes diagrams, screenshots, and Markdown reports.

##  3. Network Protocol Reports  
Detailed markdown writeups covering:

- DNS  
- TCP  
- ARP  
- TLS  
- HTTP (optional)

#  My Cybersecurity Journey  
I am actively developing:

- Blue Team skills  
- Log analysis experience  
- Network investigation abilities  
- Bash scripting & automation  
- SOC workflow understanding  
- Forensic reporting discipline  

My goal is to become a *SOC Analyst (Tier 1)* and then grow into *Incident Response*.
